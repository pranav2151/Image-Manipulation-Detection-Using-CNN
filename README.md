Image manipulation detection is a method used to determine if a picture has been altered or manipulated from its original state. In todayâ€™s digital age, where cameras and smartphones are widely used for capturing and sharing photos, and image-processing software is readily available, the act of editing and distributing photographs has become commonplace.
There are several techniques employed in image manipulation, with the most popular ones being splicing, copy move, and removal. Copy move involves duplicating or relocating elements within an image to conceal or introduce fake information. Splicing, on the other hand, involves copying portions of one image and pasting them into another, often to enhance a scene by adding new elements.

Scope and Objective:
To detect whether the image is manipulated or not.
To identify the manipulated area in image. 
To detect the type of image manipulation (splicing/copy-move).
